0,im_so_meta,"Jul 27, 2019",10,"Homelander is genuinely one of the best villains I’ve seen put to screen. Such a brilliantly reserved, nuanced and menancing display of acting. The story was great as well, with good pacing, and had me hooked throughout its 8 episode run time."
1,Spaulding1980,"Aug  7, 2019",8,"I was pleasantly surprised. This isn't a show about superheros, rather it is about corruption, vengeance, and ego rather than it being about Superman fighting villain X. In fact, the show is a timely twist on the superhero genre. The good: good acting, strong world construction, believable characters, good dialogue, entertaining, and mentioned earlier, developed and well-done themes. The bad: the violence is slightly overdone (body parts and people explode every episode), but it is on par with modern TV these days (Rome, Game of Thrones, etc.)."
2,nurall,"Nov 14, 2019",10,best show i've seen all year. i didn't know anything about the show when i saw it except that everyone was telling me to watch it.
3,FireCard,"Nov  6, 2019",10,8 hours of enjoiment. One of the best series now. I am looking forward to continuing.
4,JonDoc,"Aug 13, 2019",10,"The is the new Game of Thrones.  Utterly compelling, dark, unpredictable, hopeful. This is a post-modern anti-superhero superhero story. So many engaging themes- famous cameos too! A multilayered delight. If you feel you’ve seen every type of superhero film. Watch The Boys."
5,dogboy,"Aug 25, 2019",10,This show is just pure awesomesauce.  Fantastic casting and truly terrifying superheroes.  Love it.
6,drlowdon,"Oct 10, 2020",8,"Based on the comic book of the same name, The Boys follows a team of vigilantes as they investigate the shady Voight corporation and their teams of ‘super heroes’ who abuse their abilities. Whilst this adaptation shares many of the characters, and some of the major plot points, with the comic books the creators have very much decided to plot their own course rather than faithfully recreate the comics frame by frame. Sometimes its for the better, sometimes it’s not, but overall they’ve done a good job of bringing this world to our screens and I look forward to season two."
7,mrmonster,"Jul 30, 2019",8,"The Boys is a great show, with a very engaging plot, very engaging protagonists, and a really good villain. Over all, everything about this show just works, it's so good.."
8,ShiArch,"Aug 11, 2019",10,Don't trust the critics they just want boring and artsy documentaries.This is the best show on TV this year. Better than any marvel movie and better than any TV show. Dude who played the role of Homelander shall be given an Oscar for best acting. Awesome series. 10/10
9,Angel_Sigh,"Aug 12, 2019",8,"I've only watched the first three episodes but I felt like I had to say something about this series. There have been so many attempts at interesting superhero tv shows over the years and none have been entirely successful. Heroes had its first season, but that was fifteen years ago, and recently there has been a glut of shows like Umbrella Academy, Jessica Jones, Legion, etc... None have quite worked and most have been pretty dismal. So I didn't have particularly high hopes for this. And I don't read comic books, so I've no idea about the story this is based on. And Karl Urban's accent in the trailers almost put me off altogether(whoever told him he could do a ""Bri'ish accent ma'ey gorblummy luvaduggle"" should be put on trial at the Hague). But it kicks off with one of the strongest first episodes I've ever seen and keeps going, introducing an utterly moreish cast of nutty characters and superhero archetypes, all with their own appealing/disgusting traits.The plot and motivations of the main characters have been kept in the vault so far, but the Seven, the group of all-conquering and utterly terrifying superheroes who serve as the sort-of bad guys in the show, are all, without exception, fantastic characters. Plenty of people have mentioned how brilliant a bad guy Homelander(the Superman stand-in) is, but The Deep, the useless Aquaman-type poseur, who gets tip-offs from porpoises, and Translucent, the lecherous invisible man who hangs around the women's lavs, are both excellent. The writing is not comedic, but it's sparky and funny enough to keep you engaged throughout, and there are some superb scenes that depict perfectly the way corporate America would respond to, and attempt to mould, superheroes if they actually existed. We get to see an innocent, idealistic young woman, inducted into The Seven early on, bridle and buck as Vought, the giant mega-corporation that controls the superheroes(and most of Washington), bombards her with publicity-speak recommendations about everything from the things she says to the clothes she wears. One of my favourite scenes is where a couple of PR goons are wheeled in to convince her that the skimpy new costume she's being coerced into wearing is actually 'empowering' and 'feminist'. The quality of the writing is very, very good - it crackles. It's a gory show - there's a lot of blood and brains, assorted viscera, and there are scenes warning of the dangers of dynamite suppositories; some of it is not exactly sophisticated. And yet...it's got intelligence. It's not dumb, you can tell that there are talented, intelligent people controlling the flow of the show. There is a bite to its satirical elements. It handles the cynicism of Vought perfectly. And there is a depth to the characters, especially the main hero, an everyman whose girlfriend literally explodes when a runaway alternate-universe Flash charges through her while she's standing on the edge of a pavement. This tragedy - and they do a good job of making it feel tragic - powers most of the series so far.The other character with the most depth is, well...Homelander. They have leaned into the superpowers more than any other superhero show I've ever seen, really showing the consequences of, say, getting hit by a man moving at 1000mph - and the most liberating aspect of this is that they have a chance to show what a Superman would be capable of doing if he had no qualms about killing human beings. This is what making Homelander the villain gives you: the chance to demonstrate how truly menacing the world would be with a capricious, amoral Superman in it. And it is genuinely frightening. He is a frightening presence on screen. He has a dead smile, and cold, calculating eyes; always perfectly calm...until the mask slips just a little and we see the barely-restrained desire to hurt and maim that lies under the surface. He makes the viewer's skin crawl, and there are further aspects to his(truly warped) persona that make him even more disturbing. Like I said, I'm only three episodes in, but it's so much sheer, runaway FUN that I felt the need to give it a good write-up. I was leaning towards a 9/10....but the simple fact that I'm less than halfway through means I'm going to have to give it an 8. But absolutely take my word for it - I haven't felt enthused about a mainstream fantasy tv show like this since Game Of Thrones. That's high praise(let's forget seasons 6, 7 and(most especially) 8 existed and admit that GOT was one of the great TV shows for more than half of its run). I'd warn anyone reading that it's...really gory, in an absurdist, comic-book way. So if you don't like people's entrails popping out, or their brains getting slowly squashed out of their skull then maybe think twice. Don't say you weren't warned. Other than that, just watch it - more than anything else on telly right now it's just so much FUN."
10,SWEEPtheLEG175,"Jul 30, 2019",9,"When you look back over some of the best movies or shows of all time, you will find something they all have in common, a great VILLAIN.  This show has that and it has Karl Urban.  Dennis Quad/Meg Ryan's  kid is not bad either(usually the apple falls far from the tree...not here though)."
11,Faronlinegamers,"Oct  9, 2020",9,"The boys: A world where superheroes are basically dickheads, a world where superheroes have the stress and mental state as normal humans like you and me. Things I like: 1. The concept: Superheroe movies have always been about them being the good guys, take marvel: avengers for example, the boys however takes a very different and gory route, they basically take real life with a team of super heroes, like the justice league, and turn it into a super hero gore movie which personally Is refreshing to the superhero genre. 2. The gore: gore has barley been in superhero movies, especially marvel (unless we’re talking about deadpool 1+2), the boys uses this as an advantage using it to make a difference between normal superhero movies and their own show, it also allows the director or writers of the show to tell the story without any restrictions. 3. Character development: the story has multiple normal human being/superhero protagonists, for example one protagonist we start off with is Hughie Campbel, a normal human being who's (SPOILER) friend, named robin gets killed in a Dramatic gory way where A-Train (a speedster, like quicksilver or the flash) runs into Robin who explodes in a really gory way. The story later adds unique details about this character later on, eventually joining ”the boys”. With Billy. Things I don't like: the only thing I really dont like about the boys is the lack of huge fight scenes, obviously they probably didn't have the budget for that, but since the success of the first season, the might improve it in season 3, as they somewhat did in season 2."
12,greenisgood,"Jul 30, 2020",9,"TL;DR - When I started this show I assumed it would end in itself and could not think of any reason this would progress further than Season 1.But I cannot wait to see our fantastically written, exceptionally executed, morally flawed characters 'Supes' or Humans in Season 2. Avoiding all spoilers for this as I truly believe a fan of the genre whether it be comics, movies old or new should really watch it. This was a breath of fresh air. The writing of this show was on par with some of the best Pilot seasons we have gotten. After all of the Glimmering and Shinning portrayals of the 'Superhero' in current media it is good to see a point of view where we watch them being just as flawed and messed up as we can be. This makes sense considering they are existing in a world based on rules humans have created and hence would by default glorify and pursue everything that we covet/desire secretly or other wise. As much as I LOVE 'DC' my distaste for the DCEU is probably on par with the same. Snyder does have talent but I believe what this Show pulls off successfully is what he was going for, but unfortunately his own ego and heady themes overpowered the writing.It is downright funny to think in retrospect of people name-calling/labeling those who did not like DCEU and it's so called gritty realism, I bet MCU and or DCEU lovers and all alike will really find entertainment and satisfaction is this gritty, relatively realistic sometimes disturbing take on the 'Superhero' genre."
13,Bitbat,"Aug  3, 2019",8,"The first episode is the best part. This show goes into what's on the other side of Superheroes, and how a band of brothers in arms gets revenge for their fallen loved ones. The jokes are good. Be warned it is very graphic and contains mild nudity and dark humour."
14,MyOpinionReview,"Aug 29, 2019",10,"Fun, Action-packed, Comedy, Romance. The Boys has all of these things. From great and lovable characters to heroes gone bad, The Boys is now one of my favorite shows. From start to end is just so entertaining. Homelander is an amazing villain and Butcher is just brilliantly written. With great jokes from start to end. If you have Amazon Prime, this is a MUST watch."
15,hello_world,"Sep  9, 2019",7,"This is a dark take on the superheroes, not unlike other stories such as watchmen or irredeemable. It  still feels fresh as a television show nonetheless. Don't come in expecting a bombardment of action scenes as we are often expecting from the mainstream movies. The boys takes a much more dramatic and character driven story and manages to pull it off rather well.  The Boys came out at just the right time as it serves a critique on our current culture of idolising superheroes in our media and serves as a not so subtle allegory to celebrity culture in general."
16,Ixidorsdreams,"Jul 27, 2019",8,"I enjoyed the show very thoroughly thru five episodes and then began to wonder why it felt aimless.The twist at the end with Homelander and Becca being alive was definitely welcome (and well earned with how they played it during the lead up) as otherwise I worried they were going to fail to land this thing.Obviously there is source material to work from, but overall it was well acted and well written in terms if dialogue. Show has tons of potential for Season 2 with perhaps a (true) “evil” turn from The Deep being set up, Becca’s side of leaving with her kid from Homelander, Black Noir hasn’t really been investigated AT ALL, spots open on the Seven with A Train and Translucent gone (the laters death likely lumped with the prior for sake of media) and growth from the Kimiko character who appears to at minimum be Wolverine and potentially greater. Not to mention the Supe Terrorists which I expect is the main arch allowing Homelander to take further control in the Military. This was honestly a great surprise, and I’d started high on the show around 9/10 rating. Dipped it back down to a 6/7 when it wandered a bit in the middle, but really got me reinvested late."
17,dml1984,"Aug 14, 2019",8,"Great show. Funny, well acted, and nice alternative to the typical superhero flare. Highly recommend."
18,MarshallCavalli,"Aug 15, 2019",9,This is reminiscent of Watchmen in a good and bad way. Good that it deconstructs the genre of superhero stories and the characters. Bad because it is excessively graphic without having a reason to be so and a season closer that is not something that should be done.
19,cinekid,"Aug 23, 2019",9,"magine: what would happen if there were people with mega cool suppppapower, super hero organizations, competitions and tests to become a super star of justice ... yes like the avengers but ... not the avengers and above all not the marvel universe..but our world, full of corruption, wickedness, careerism, sadism, cynicism and ... money and power in the wrong hands, this is the beginning, do you think discounted it? I don't want to spoil it .. remember what I said: it's our world."
20,Snarkk,"Jan 14, 2020",7,"Indécent et caustique durant les tout premiers épisodes, avant de partir sur quelque chose de bien plus conventionnel malgré une réalisation ""moderne"" qui peut te faire croire que la série avance dans la lignée de son pilote. C'est faux, hélas. Ca n'en reste pas moins divertissant. Je tenterai probablement le coup pour la saison 2, mais sans trépigner d'avance pour autant."
21,wayrez,"May 16, 2020",8,"I recommend this series not only to fans of the genre, but also in general to all fans of cinema and TV series. Beautiful picture pleases the eye, gorgeous, chic soundtrack caresses the ear, the speaker is, the story keeps in suspense."
22,Reviewsformedia,"Oct 11, 2020",9,"I watched this back when it came out in late of last year. In August, I re-watched it in preparation for season 2. I enjoyed it even more. This won't be a long review but The Boys is a fantastic commentary on the superhero genre and the marketing business as a whole. It's got some great political messages that don't feel too forced and it's coated with an over the top, bloody flair filled with shocking and engaging story lines and moments made even better by the brilliantly written and wonderfully acted characters that bounce off of each other phenomenally well. My personal favourite is Homelander, Antony Starr is perfect in the role and his character is by far the most well written with the best development and moments. Overall, watching season 1 again gave me a much needed recap and even gave me an additional appreciation for the things in the show that i did't pay much attention to the first time around. It's gone up from my previous 8.5/10 to a solid 9. It's one of the best shows on TV right now and my personal favourite superhero show next to Daredevil. The only gripes i have is that the colour grading is kind of ass, some of Butcher's lines are a little too over the top with edge and now and again it has some choppy editing. Aside from that, The Boys is a fantastic show and a breath of fresh air into the superhero genre.4/59/10Overall - 8.66/10"
23,DarkWind47,"Jul 16, 2020",10,"Обалденный сериал! Очень крута идея, где главный герой не супергерой, а простой человек, тогда как супергерои настоящие злодеи. Рекомендую к просмотру, особенно в озвучке ""кубик в кубе"". Сам очень жду второй сезон"

25,AthanasiosT,"Sep  8, 2019",10,"How would superheroes act, if they actually existed in real life ? Marvel and DC usually show their poetic versions, but this show goes deeply in the human psyche and shows a cruel and dark reality. Excellently written (adapted), directed, shot, and acted. A must for all superhero (adult) fans."

31,spartacus215,"Jul 29, 2019",10,"I will start by saying that I have yet to read the graphic novel series by Garth Ennis though I intend to start it since I have bought the entire series. I’m strictly basing this review off of the show and not the contrasting differences of the comic. The show is about The Boys AKA a specialized group of people seeking to take down the conglomerate known as Vought who use The Seven whom is an alternative JL of sorts down. Simple yet very effective with a handful of really well done twists. The acting was Incredible. The standouts being The Homelander played by Antony Starr whom I’m overjoyed is coming off of his hit show Banshee. Literally killing it as a clone of Supes. The second being Billy Butcher played by Karl Urban. Incredible acting with multiple dashes of humor. Everyone as a collective did an outstanding job of selling the world minus one or two whom seemed out of place. The action was fire; this is what happens when you have a company like Amazon take the reins on a Mature comic and have no censorship and allowing the team to make it how it deserves to be made and in-turn allowing your fan base to be delighted. Lots of cursing and limbs flying to make the Cirque du Soleil jealous. The cinematography was stunning. The world being sold even though it’s on a small scale with it seeming to expand in S2. I’d recommend this show in a heartbeat if you enjoy the likes of Deadpool, Logan and other M rated versions of comic related material. 8 episodes goes by way too fast. Excited for S2."
32,Rooster7102,"Aug  6, 2019",10,Was hooked after the first 15 minutes of episode one. Enjoyed the multiple character storylines. Was a fun ride seeing super heroes in a different light.
33,BioTofu,"Nov 26, 2019",9,"Super hero movie done right. Good story, good world building, good characters, good acting."
34,papadrew7,"Aug  1, 2019",10,"What an incredible first season! The boys put a great original spin on the super genre by, I believe, making super heroes more realistic. The timeless saying goes 'Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' Realistically super heroes would not act like saints like in the marvel universe but far more like this show does. Which is why I love this show. The acting is great. The story is captivating and I never feel like the series is slowing down. What I also love is that from the first episode you know that this not a show for kids and it GOES THERE and shows very disturbing scenes. Also homelander is one of the best villains I have seen in a long time and starlight was great as well."
35,MonsieurAthos,"Oct 26, 2019",9,"Hallelujah! A superhero show that knows how to invert the genre without falling prey to the sort of hamfisted preaching that the ""make everything political"" zealots infuse their clockwork hypno-propaganda with, churning out unwashed ideas from the looney tune sausage factory. This show has verve, takes risks and brandishes  iconoclastic jabs at everything with equal hilarious measure, knowing above all else the value of providing ""hell yes"" entertainment. And the Homelander character makes missed-opportunity-Brightburn look like a punk. Loving these twisted takes on comics! Watch this instead of cringe AF Watchmen."
36,andreag,"Jul 26, 2019",10,Incredibly sharp and timely deconstruction of superheroes. Highly recommend.

38,insickness,"Jul 30, 2019",10,"Netflix, pay attention: this is how superhero shows are made. Engaging from start to finish. Not endless melodramatic talky filler. Sex, violence, a lot of plot movement and a great story. I just hope the next season is as good as this one."

44,myrabrandish,"Sep 20, 2020",0,"I’ve peered on numerous sites and was going to remain silent until I heard the series creator’s response to the backlash. What an arrogant little troll. Anyone blasting 1 star displeasure as ‘immature’ --- SHAME ON YOU! Since we weren’t surveyed, this provides an effective medium to express our disdain towards the decision makers at amazon thereby improving the likelihood they won’t repeat these mistakes during season 3 (which has already been renewed). Although I disapprove of the release schedule, what irks me the most is the lack of transparency. I am not the only person duped into believing that this season would be released congruently. Streaming services are becoming aware that middle America patterns their subscription habits around the service release schedules. Couple months on this one, then a couple on that. I can’t afford all of them simultaneously. If amazon was clear that a weekly release schedule was there plan, I would have postponed my membership for another month and enjoyed bingeing the season entirely within ONE Billing Cycle. I’m not the world’s richest man. I’m a single mother struggling with reduced hours during a pandemic. That’s why I’m pissed. You baited me into TWO Billing cycles instead of ONE. Decision wasn’t for ‘”weekly conversations” it was a Ca$h Grab."

46,Rudyger,"Nov  3, 2019",5,"Despite some annoying characters (Hughie, Frenchie), the first 4 episodes are truly amazing. One of the best shows of the last few years, and a really interesting take on superheroes. However, after episode 5, the series strangely plummets into average content. Bad and redundant dialogue. Boring plot points...etc. I guess most of the 10 ratings were given right after the first few episodes. It's impossible not to notice the hard change between the first and second half. And the season finale cliffhanger left me quite... indifferent. 10/10 for episodes 1 to 4.3/10 for episodes 5 to 8"
47,SilverCenturion,"Jul 28, 2019",5,"Drops any premise of faithfulness to the source material after the first episode. Completely disregards the point of the original. Very mediocre story. Typical Hollywood misrepresentations of Christians abound. The ""twist"" at the end sucked and could be seen coming from a mile away. I gave it a five because I love the characters. I'd probably give it a six if it didn't take so long to bring The Female into the fold. Watch it if you're bored, but don't drop something else in favor of The Boys."

The best way to think of this is like the difference between Starship Troopers the novel and Verhoeven's film, but where as Verhoeven had a point to make, Amazon just wanted the name recognition to squeeze a little more money out of a remarkably bland series.I don't blame you for liking it if you haven't read the comic, but if you are a fan of Ennis's insightful original story, do yourself a favor and just skip it."

58,JonsGone,"Aug  9, 2019",4,"Yet another series in the ""edgy"" subgenre, but what sets it apart from contenders such as Happy, American Gods or Utopia is that The Boys fails at being anything but painfully, dreadfully average.The bargain bin knockoffs that this show parades as ""superheroes"" are nothing else than pathetic, childish attempts at subverting popular superheroic figures that amount to nothing but petty potshots and a glaring lack of any real criticism.In all fairness, The Boys is watchable, it isnt frustratingly dumb, nor is it bad, you could be done with it in a weekend given its length and if you truly enjoy this subgenre of edgy serials, this is not a deviation from any of its defining qualities. However it lacks any kind of a conclusion to its first season, it just feels as if they truncated a single storyline into however many seasons they plan to do, as such, this first installment of The Boys feels just like an incomplete cashgrab starring vague, reminescent heroic figures, riding on the superhero trend while trying to draw people in by being overly edgy.It does not work.In time it will flush away like all the other bland pieces of media who do not try to change the game or be the best at it.And its produced by Amazon.Watch it if you want to, I cant stop you, but just know there are plenty of other, better shows in the same style you could watch. 5/10 → -1 Amazon = 4/10"

Aside from SOME of the people, places, and things, absolutely NOTHING of the original comics made it to the show and that the very intelligent and well written socio-political, gender, sexual, societal, racial commentary and issues were either completely taken out, or watered down for cheap lulz, stupid shock value, disposable entertainment, and wokeness, such as Starlight becoming some kind of crusading feminist, or changing Mallory and Stillwell into women. The Boys belongs on a network HBO which wouldn't be afraid to display its original source material in its full, graphic, edgy, glory, not on Amazon which is obviously using this to get into the superhero game to make money. If you like or want to like this show, fine, just don't read the original comics or be prepared for a massive disappointment. Those who read the comics first and want to watch this, spare yourself such disappointment and just don't waste your time. It's also very disappointing that Garth Ennis allowed them to water down and neuter his classic, but I guess piles of money from the world's biggest retailer will do that."
60,wevertonaguiiar,"Aug  9, 2019",6,Série muito repetitiva e muito vaga; a série tem dificuldades em transitar entre tensão e humor.
61,moviewatcherclb,"Aug 13, 2019",6,I honestly really loved the show. Full of different characters that really bring some interesting dynamics to the show. There is a lot going and season 1 does not answer nearly enough... ready for season 2 please! Check out my full review here - https://youtu.be/4V--AyiUN4Y
62,lutherlavay,"Sep 23, 2020",0,"If you like this, then you’ll love Eric Kripke’s other Smash HiT --- How to Lose Audience in One Season. Directed by Bill Em’ Two-Cycles and Starring  Insult Them."
63,empoweredsista,"Sep 24, 2020",0,I find it absolutely repulsing that this series depicts the forceable workplace rape of an innocent womyn. Stop me if you heard this one before --- Beautiful Womyn is lured by an evil sick sexually depraved man in a position of authority AND in order to keep this career that she worked sooooo hard for she is compelled to betray her every instinct and live with shame and regret. Right out of the Weinstein playbook. The Boys writers must be Harvey disciples. #MeToo
64,TheQuietGamer,"Aug 10, 2019",7,"I hoped it would be more of a skewering of today's superhero obsessed culture, but I ultimately still enjoyed The Boys for its blood soaked, foul-mouthed anarchy in a time where our masked vigilantes have to remain squeeky clean to ensure box-office domination. There are some shots taken at how mass marketed the superhero genre has become, but I would have appreciated just a bit more on this front. The underrated Karl Urban is of course fantastic as always. Really carrying the show here as a lot of the side-characters aren't given too much to do (a flaw in the comics as well). The plot and world-building are interesting and I remained glued to the screen across each of the 8 episodes, but admittedly there isn't much depth to any of this. Overall, The Boys isn't quite the next big superhero takeover or even the slayers of this ever-growing pop culture juggernaut cycle we're on. What it is however if a vulgar, hyper-violent look at what it could be like if superheroes actually existed and got as big as their onscreen counterparts."
65,Dodger,"Jul 27, 2019",7,An above average series. Fairly formulaic in its story beats with a couple of interesting twists and concepts. Worth a watch if you have prime.
66,brockcheese,"Oct  3, 2020",7,This show is a very interesting dissection of corporate greed and corruption of power. It uses the superhero genre as a staging ground to explore deeper themes about wealth disparity.
67,marcmyworks,"Aug 19, 2019",9,"The Boys season 1 brings the action, comedy and intrigue needed for superhero TV shows as well creates a dark and sinister world. Think of a cross between The Justice League, Brightburn and Kickass."
68,eagleeyeviking,"Aug 10, 2019",7,"While some twists and story beats feel formulaic, ""The Boys""' satire of superheroism and corporatism is skilful."
69,dr0nzer,"Oct 18, 2020",7,"Jack Quaid (Hughie Campbell) has one face and one expression, literally drags down the series as a whole and I found him annoying to watch, otherwise it's great, all other actors and actresses does a great job, it doesn't lend itself too seriously and its a fun series to watch, sound, and editing is on point."
70,manningn15,"Feb  6, 2021",10,"This is my favorite superhero tv show, my favorite black comedy show, one of my favorite comedy shows, my 2nd favorite Amazon Prime original show, 2nd favorite new shows of 2019, and one of my top 10 favorite shows of all time. The writing is phenomenal and hilariously dark. The lead acting is remarkable especially from Antony Starr, Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Erin Moriarty, Chace Crawford, Elizabeth Shue, Tomer Kapon, Karen Fukuhara, Jessie Usher, Dominique McElligott, and Laz Alonso. Jennifer Esposito, Simon Pegg, and Colby Minifie gave great supporting performances. The guest performances from Alex Hassell, Brittany Allen, Haley Joel Osment, and Shaun Benson were excellent. The outfits and costumes are stupendous, well made, and cool looking especially Erin Moriarty's outfits and costumes, Antony Starr's costume, Chace Crawford's costume, Karl Urban's outfits, Dominique McElligott's costume, Jessie Usher's costume, Elizabeth Shue's outfits, Shaun Benson's costume, and Nathan Mitchell's costume. The visual and special effects are outstanding and awesome looking especially Homelander's and the super babies laser eyes, Starlight's powers, The Deep's gills, Ezekiel's powers, Popclaw's powers, the dolphin, and Translucent's powers. The music that is featured in the series is really terrific. The hairstyling and makeup are superb especially on Erin Moriarty, Antony Starr, Dominique McElligott, Karen Fukuhara, Jessie Usher, Shaun Benson, Karl Urban, and Elizabeth Shue. The accessories are fantastic especially Dominique McElligott's, Nathan Mitchell's, and Erin Moriarty's. This is a definite A+ show."
71,Saymoran,"Aug  3, 2019",7,"It is solid show, it reminds me a lot to “Watchmen”. Plot is easy to guess, no hard drama or surprises there but it doesn’t bother much."
72,BM85,"Aug 27, 2019",7,"PROS: compelling layered central characters; relevant themes smartly handled; intelligent storytelling; intriguing season story arc with many memorable moments; top-notch visual effects.CONS: gratuitous bloody violence; a few boring secondary characters; sometimes it's too dark for a show with ""Supes"" dressed in ridiculous costumes; CIA high officials portrayed as ""the good guys""."
73,Ahmed_Alwazir,"Oct 12, 2019",9,"That's what I call a game-changer. It's a new take on Superheroes from a new perspective. I have to be honest, that's the most realistic story about superheroes. It feels that it can really happen. It's very entertaining with a deep touch f drama."
74,pur__0_0__,"Apr 25, 2021",10,"A few years back I was starting to gain some interest in superheroes. I had just begun to watch Marvel and DC movies. Then one of my friends suggested me aboutThe Boys back when season 1 had just begun. I wasn't very much interested in in Amazon Prime so I thought should give it a try when I get time to do so. And when I got the subscription this was the very first thing I saw. The Boys is set in a dystopian society where superheroes a something of a cultural identity. Unlike Watchmen where people were shown to have lost their interest and superheroes because of their existence in the real world, people in The Boys absolutely adore the superheroes. They watch the movies, buy their toys, read their books, and do everything with way more passion than we do for superheroes. Homelander is given the same reputation as Superman, and is worshipped like a demigod. The truth, however, is completely different. Nowadays it has become a trend to show that superheroes are flawed people. They also have many wrong habits and tend to make mistakes. But this show takes it on a completely different level. Superheroes are not interested in in doing their job of serving humanity at all. Rather they are owned by corporations like Vought, who use them for marketing purposes and for selling the dream of becoming a superhero by injecting children with Compound V as kids. And the gullible people do not question this as it has become something of a taboo to speak against these gods who live among us. The only people who dare to speak against them are The Boys, a team of misfits led by Billy Butcher. In the beginning of the show they are able to take out Translucent and use his dead body to taunt Homelander. Starlight is is one of the members of the seven who actually wants to serve humanity but is tried to be bullied into submission by The Deep, A-Train and Homelander. I really like how all of them get their comeuppance, do I feel a little bad for The Deep. In season 2 he was shown to have been bullied as a kid and that is word changed his personality. This is something which clearly states how false Vought's propaganda about having the happy life of being a superhero is. Homelander is also shown to hate faking his origin story just for the entertainment of the people. A-Train was also a bad guy but helps out in season 2 and can also be excused for being a drug addict."
75,TudorPopescu,"Oct 31, 2020",10,"A gory, dark, mature anti-superhero series which subverts our expectations and notions about what being a superhero means. Themes of capitalism, corporatism, power, greed, and fame are explored. Great performance from the actors across the board. All of these elements are tied together with a well-written and interesting story."
76,Johannes_,"Sep 11, 2020",9,"It is dark, it is very well acted and it offers an array of interesting and flawed characters. I went in with no expectations at all and I was blown away by it. One of the most surprising TV shows in years."
77,Beanbean801,"Nov 15, 2020",10,Ignore the negative reviews from people complaining it doesn’t adhere to the source material. This is a huge positive. Characters feel like human beings. From story telling to cinematography. This show is absolutely brilliant in every way.
78,geewah,"Dec 24, 2020",9,"Thoroughly entertaining entry into the superhero genre.Yes it can be violent and crass but snappy writing uses this to it's advantage and it delivers"
79,iCampoRamil,"May 29, 2021",7,"Así de primeras, es bastante cruda, no se miden, es gore, me gusta.En ocasiones tiene ese toque grunge que no me convence demasiado, no me mola.La fotografía, eso sí, es bastante buena.Bien los personajes, por lo general, los súpers también son tontos, y los humanos son humanos. Todo porque todos empiezan con muy bien transfondo que viene de antes y que te van desvelando poquito a poquito.El final de temporada me pareció bastante típico, lo de suplantar al líder y ahora en la S2 se viene nuevo líder, meh.Cosas buenas: El reparto, genial, muy buen vestuario, la cinematografía generalmente, y los temas que trata, que pese a basarse todo en una comedia negra, se tratan cosas serias.Cosas malas: Sobre todo peca bastante de ritmo, y a veces hay giros que están algo mal planteados.Conclusión: Es una serie bastante buena, disfrutona, que da otra visión a lo que estimamos como cine de superhéroes, recomendada."
